This tool is used to extract and pack Huawei Firmware as follows:

Steps:
Requirement:
• Tools required: binwalk, unsquashfs, mksquashfs in Linux Based Machine, HWFW_GUI.exe tool and Hex Editor HxD on windows machine.
• Two virtual machines required, one Lunux Based to run tools like binwalk, unsquashfs, mksquashfs etc and another Windows machine to run tools HWFW_GUI.exe and HxD Hex Editor.

On Linux Machine:
• Download the orginalhuaweifirmware.bin
• binwalk originalhuaweifirmware.bin
On Windows OS:
• download Huawei Firmware Editor Tool (HWFW_GUI.exe):
• Also download and install tool HxD Hex Editor on windows
• Download/copy the orginalhuaweifirmware.bin firmware file here in windows machine
• Execute HWFW_GUI.exe -> File-> Open->Originalfirmware.bin ->clickon “Contains Project Information” in Left pain window->
  click on flash:rootfs in right window pain->Right click on flash:rootfs in right window pain->Edit Item->Export->
  save at ur desired location with any name for e.g rootfsoriginalhuaweifirmware->save 
  (This is how we extracted the rootfs part with its header from original firmware by using tool HWFW_GUI.exe)
• Now shift this extracted rootfsoriginalfirmware file to Linux machine

On Linux Machine:
• binwalk rootfsoriginalhuaweifirmware
• binwalk -e rootfsoriginalfirmware (Extracted the squashfs file system from the file)
• cd _rootfsoriginalfirmware.extracted/squashfs-root
• Now you may analyze the extracted file system of huawei firmware to find any vulnerability or to do any modification
• Now pack the file system after modification
  mksquashfs _rootfsoriginalhuaweifirmware.extracted/squashfs-root rootfs_new_of_originalhuaweifirmware -comp xz -b 131072 
  (This will create the new root squashfs file system)
   In above command, you may check the compression type(-comp option: lzma, xz etc and block size(-b option: 512, 1024, 131072 etc) 
   either through binwalk as: binwalk rootfsoriginalfirmware or binwalk originalfirmware or through unsquashfs command as: unsquashfs -s rootfsoriginalfirmware 
• Now copy/shift this new modified squashfs file system “rootfs_new_of_originalhuaweifirmware” file to Windows OS machine

On Windows OS:
• Open HxD Hex Editor->File->open->rootfsoriginalhuaweifirmware, File->open->rootfs_new_of_originalhuaweifirmware 
  (open both files rootfsoriginalhuaweifirmware and rootfs_new_of_originalhuaweifirmware in HxD Editor)
• Compare above both files, rootfsoriginalhuaweifirmware also has firmware ui header before squashfs file system (sqsh magic bytes or shsq or hsqs magic bytes) 
  while rootfs_new_of_originalhuaweifirmware i.e modified rootfs dont have this ui firmware header before squashfs file system because as we did not add it while making it through mksquashfs, 
  it only make the squashfs system without header.
• Now copy all hexcode before magic bytes sqsh from rootfsoriginalhuaweifirmware to rootfs_new_of_originalhuaweifirmware before magic bytes sqsh or shsq
• now save this edited rootfs_neworiginalfirmware file in HxD Hex Editor as rootfs_new2_of_originalhuaweifirmware
• Execute/Open HWFW_GUI.exe -> File-> Open->originalhuaweifirmware.bin ->clickon “Contains Project Information” in Left pain window->
  click on flash:rootfs in right window pain->Right click on flash:rootfs in right window pain->Edit Item->Import->
  select file rootfs_new2_of_originalhuaweifirmware->open->save->File->save as->originalhuaweifirmware_modified.bin at ur desired location
• Now your file “originalhuaweifirmware_modified.bin” is ready to upload on router.

Remarks: Successful Filesystem Extraction and Packing of huawei firmware, Tested on firmware: HG8245V100R006C00SPC122_full_all.bin
